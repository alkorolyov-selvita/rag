After the initial dietary treatment all patients were given twice \\ndaily for 14 days 500 mg clofibrate. During the use of the \"prudent\" diet the \\nserum-cholesterol-levels decreased in average with 14.8%.

The rate of formation of dopa and \\n5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) was studied by measuring the accumulation of these \\namino acids during 30 min after administration of the inhibitor of the aromatic \\nL-amino acid decarboxylase, NSD 1015 (3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine HCl). Haloperidol \\ncaused an increase in dopa and no change in 5-HTP formation. The threshold dose \\nwas severalfold higher in the noradrenaline-predominated hemisphere portion than \\nin the dopamine-rich striatal and limbic regions, suggesting a higher affinity \\nof haloperidol for dopamine than for noradrenaline receptors. Apomorphine caused \\na decrease in dopa formation in all three brain regions studied, although the \\neffect was much more pronounced in the regions dominated by dopamine. The \\nthreshold dose was about 30 microng/kg, i.e. an order of magnitude lower than \\nthe threshold dose for apparent postsynaptic dopaminergic receptor activation. \\nThis discrepancy is suggested to be due to preferential activation of inhibitory \\ndopaminergic autoreceptors by low apomorphine doses. This phenomenon may also \\ncontribute to explain the complex dose-response curves of apomorphine. Low doses \\nof apomorphine caused a decrease and high doses an increase in 5-HTP formation. \\nThese effects, like those on noradrenaline synthesis, are suggested to be \\nsecondary to activation of dopaminergic pre- and post-synaptic receptors. The \\ninteraction between apomorphine and haloperidol with respect to dopa formation \\nappears to be largely explicable on the assumption of a competition between an \\nagonist and an antagonist for dopaminergic receptors.

       " 'Thermoplasma acidophilum, a thermophilic mycoplasma, has several unusual \\nfeatures suggesting a possible relationship to eukaryotic cells. One feature is \\na histone-like protein that is associated with the DNA, condensing it into \\nsubunits similar to those in eukaryotic chromatin. A second feature is an \\nassociation of cytoplasmic proteins that resembles eukaryotic actin and myosin. \\nThese two components are widely distributed in different groups of eukaryotic \\ncells, but are typically lacking in prokaryotic cells. Furthermore, T. \\nacidophilum lacks cytochromes and respires by enzymes that apparently are not \\ncoupled to oxidative phosphorylation. This primitive type of respiration \\nresembles that of microbodies, another feature which is represented in the \\ncytoplasm of all groups of eukaryotic cells. Furthermore, since T. acidophilum \\nlacks a cell wall and appears to have a primitive correlate of endocytosis, it \\nwould appear to be mechanically capable of acquiring a symbiotic mitochondrion. \\nThus, our observations are consistent with the symbiotic hypothesis for the \\norigin of eukaryotic cells. We suggest that an organism similar to T. \\nacidophilum was the host cell for the original symbiosis, becoming the nucleus \\nand cytoplasm of modern eukaryotic cells.',\n",

In a reticulocyte \\nlysate analogs and enzymic decapping had a similar effect on translation. In a \\nwheat germ extract, mRNA decapping resulted in a more pronounced decrease of \\nmRNA activity, presumably due to the increased susceptibility of decapped mRNAs \\nto the nucleases present in this protein synthesis system. 3.

A combination of NSD 1015 (100 mg/kg) \\nand benserazide (50 mg/kg) potentiated L-DOPA behaviour more effectively than \\neither inhibitor alone. NSD 1015-facilitated L-DOPA behaviour was antagonized by \\nsulpiride (100 mg/kg) and not by SCH 23390 (1 mg/kg), whereas \\nbudipine-facilitated L-DOPA behaviour was fully antagonized by SCH 23390 and \\nonly partially by sulpiride. These results show that behaviourally active doses \\nof L-DOPA in the reserpinized rat are not accompanied by significant increases \\nin extracellular dopamine and are therefore probably not dopamine mediated. We \\npropose that L-DOPA is capable of directly stimulating dopamine D2 and possibly \\nnon-dopamine receptors, thereby inhibiting dopamine efflux presynaptically and \\npromoting motor activation postsynaptically. A stimulant action of L-DOPA on \\nmotor behaviour, preferentially mediated by D1 > D2 receptors, suggests that \\nL-DOPA may also be capable of yielding a dopamine-like response in the absence \\nof detectable dopamine release. These findings are incorporated into a new model \\nof L-DOPA's actions in the reserpinized rat, and their possible implications for \\nour understanding of L-DOPA in Parkinson's disease are discussed.\",\n",

       " {'text': \"L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia is a common side effect developed after chronic \\ntreatment with 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-l-alanine (l-DOPA) in Parkinson's disease. \\nThe biological mechanisms behind this side effect are not fully comprehended \\nalthough involvement of dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic systems \\nhas been suggested. The present study utilizes in vivo amperometry to \\ninvestigate the impact from unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions and l-DOPA (4 \\nmg/kg, including benserazide 15 mg/kg) -induced dyskinetic behavior on striatal \\nbasal extracellular glutamate concentration and potassium-evoked glutamate \\nrelease in urethane-anesthetized rats. Recordings were performed before and \\nafter local L-DOPA application in the striatum. In addition, effects from the \\n5-HT(1A) receptor agonist (2R)-(+)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin \\nhydrobromide (8-OHDPAT; 1 mg/kg) was assessed on glutamate release and on \\ndyskinetic behavior. The results revealed a bilateral ≈ 30% reduction of basal \\nextracellular glutamate concentration and attenuated potassium-evoked glutamate \\nrelease after a unilateral dopamine-depletion in L-DOPA naïve animals. In \\ndyskinetic subjects, basal glutamate concentration was comparable to normal \\ncontrols, although potassium-evoked glutamate release was reduced to similar \\nlevels as in drug naïve dopamine-lesioned animals. Furthermore, acute striatal \\nL-DOPA administration attenuated glutamate release in all groups, except in the \\ndopamine-lesioned striatum of dyskinetic animals. Co-administration of 8-OHDPAT \\nand L-DOPA decreased dyskinesia in dopamine-lesioned animals, but did not affect \\npotassium-evoked glutamate release, which was seen in normal animals. These \\nfindings indicate altered glutamate transmission upon dopamine-depletion and \\ndyskinesia.\",\n",
