- [x] Initialize Git repository
- [x] Set up Python virtual environment with Poetry
- [x] Create `pyproject.toml` with all dependencies
- [x] Create `.env.example` template

  - [x] `logger.py` with structured logging
  - [x] `__init__.py` with clean exports
  - [x] Tested and verified working
- [x] **Docker Compose Infrastructure**:
  - [x] PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector extension
  - [x] Redis 7 Alpine with persistence
  - [x] Named volumes for data persistence
  - [x] Health checks configured
  - [x] Init script for pgvector extension and schema setup
  - [x] Both services tested and healthy
- [x] **FastAPI Application Skeleton**:
  - [x] `api/main.py` with app initialization, lifespan, and routers
  - [x] `api/routes/health.py` with health check endpoint
  - [x] `api/dependencies.py` with PostgreSQL connection pool and Redis client
  - [x] `api/models.py` with Pydantic response models
  - [x] Health checks for both PostgreSQL and Redis
  - [x] Root endpoint and favicon endpoint
  - [x] Tested and verified working (200 OK)

**Key Implementation Decisions**:
- Config pattern: `config.py` file with `Settings` class (industry standard)
- PROJECT_ROOT resolution: env var ‚Üí search for pyproject.toml ‚Üí cwd fallback
- Logger: Structured format with module hierarchy support
- All fields flattened in Settings (no nested configs for Phase 0 simplicity)
- Docker Compose: Named volumes for data persistence, health checks for monitoring
- pgvector extension: Installed via init script, embeddings schema created
- Redis: AOF persistence, 512MB memory limit with LRU eviction
- FastAPI: APIRouter pattern for modular routes, lifespan for resource management
- Database: psycopg3 with ConnectionPool (sync for Phase 0, async-ready for Phase 2)
- Health checks: Return 200/503 based on service status, log warnings for failures
- Module structure: Flattened utils ‚Üí config.py/logger.py at src/rag/ root level

## üìù Session Notes

### Session 2025-10-09 (Initial Setup)
**Topics Covered**:
- Project architecture design
- Tech stack validation against 2025 industry standards
- Decision to use pgvector + FAISS (not Pinecone)
- Addition of LlamaIndex alongside LangChain
- AWS as primary cloud, GCP for Google Patents
- DVC for data versioning

**User Feedback**:
- Wants to implement code themselves with guidance
- Prefers industry-standard, high-demand technologies
- Interested in learning path from prototype to production

### Session 2025-10-11 (Utils Module Implementation)
**Topics Covered**:
- Pydantic Settings patterns and best practices
- Config file naming conventions (config.py vs settings.py)
- PROJECT_ROOT resolution strategies (hybrid pattern)
- Circular dependency problem (bootstrap vs config values)
- Python logging best practices (hierarchy, handlers, formatters)
- Industry standards for config management in production

**What Was Implemented**:
- `src/rag/utils/config.py` - Settings class with hybrid PROJECT_ROOT
- `src/rag/utils/logger.py` - Structured logging setup
- `src/rag/utils/__init__.py` - Clean module exports
- All tested and verified working

**Key Learnings**:
- Bootstrap values (PROJECT_ROOT) vs config values (database_url)
- Industry standard: config.py file with settings instance
- Hybrid PROJECT_ROOT for dev convenience + production flexibility
- Logger hierarchy using `__name__` for automatic module paths
- Avoid circular dependencies in config loading

**Next Session Goals**:
- Implement FastAPI skeleton (basic app + health check)
- OR start embeddings module (sentence-transformers wrapper)
- OR implement FAISS vector store wrapper

### Session 2025-10-11 (Docker Compose Implementation)
**Topics Covered**:
- Docker Compose architecture (services, volumes, networks, health checks)
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension setup
- Redis configuration and use cases in RAG
- Named volumes vs bind mounts
- PGDATA subdirectory pattern to avoid Docker metadata conflicts
- Init script execution (runs once on first database creation)
- Health check behavior in Docker Compose vs Kubernetes
- Volume persistence and storage locations

**What Was Implemented**:
- `docker-compose.yml` - PostgreSQL 16 + pgvector, Redis 7 Alpine
- `infrastructure/docker/postgres/init-db.sql` - pgvector extension + schema setup
- Named volumes for data persistence (postgres_data, redis_data)
- Health checks for both services

**Issues Resolved**:
1. SQL syntax error - missing semicolon in init-db.sql
2. Health check "root" user errors - fixed with `-U ${POSTGRES_USER}` flag
3. Redis command syntax with YAML folded scalar
4. Missing redis_data volume definition

**Test Results**:
- Both containers running with `(healthy)` status
- pgvector 0.8.1 extension installed and verified
- Redis responding to PING with PONG
- No errors in logs

**Key Learnings**:
- Health checks in Docker Compose only change status, don't auto-restart
- Init scripts run ONCE on first database creation, not on subsequent starts
- Named volumes stored in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`, survive container deletion
- Redis primary use: embedding caching to reduce API costs
- Default health check interval: 30s (not 10s), timeout: 30s (not 5s)

### Session 2025-10-12 (FastAPI Skeleton Implementation)
**Topics Covered**:
- FastAPI application structure and best practices
- APIRouter pattern for organizing routes by domain
- Lifespan context managers for resource management
- Dependency injection with Depends()
- Pydantic models for request/response validation
- psycopg3 vs psycopg2 (chose psycopg3 for async-ready architecture)
- ConnectionPool configuration and context manager usage
- Health check implementation patterns
- Error handling and logging strategies (health checks vs business logic)
- HTTP status codes (200 for healthy, 503 for unhealthy)
- Project structure refactoring (utils/ ‚Üí root level for config/logger)

**What Was Implemented**:
- `src/rag/api/main.py` - FastAPI app with lifespan, router registration, root + favicon endpoints
- `src/rag/api/routes/health.py` - Health check endpoint with PostgreSQL + Redis status
- `src/rag/api/dependencies.py` - PostgreSQL connection pool, Redis client, dependency functions
- `src/rag/api/models.py` - HealthResponse Pydantic model
- `src/rag/api/routes/__init__.py` - Router exports
- Refactored: Moved utils/config.py ‚Üí config.py and utils/logger.py ‚Üí logger.py

**Issues Resolved**:
1. ConnectionPool initialization - needed `kwargs` parameter, not direct keyword args
2. SecretStr password extraction - required `.get_secret_value()`
3. Missing `@contextmanager` decorator on `get_postgres_conn()`
4. PostgreSQL env var naming - `POSTGRES_DB` vs `POSTGRES_DBNAME`
5. Password authentication failed - wrong password type and localhost vs 0.0.0.0
6. Invalid HTTP request warnings - external service connecting to 0.0.0.0
7. Import from wrong contextlib - used blib2to3 instead of contextlib

**Test Results**:
- API starts successfully on `http://localhost:8000`
- `/health` endpoint returns 200 OK
- Both PostgreSQL and Redis show "healthy" status
- Swagger UI accessible at `/docs`
- Root endpoint and favicon endpoint working

**Key Learnings**:
- FastAPI lifespan replaces deprecated `@app.on_event("startup")`
- APIRouter pattern keeps routes organized and testable
- psycopg3 is modern, async-ready replacement for psycopg2
- Context managers need `@contextmanager` decorator when using `yield`
- Health check failures should log at WARNING/DEBUG, not ERROR
- Binding to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) is safer than 0.0.0.0 for local dev
- `__name__` shows `__main__` for entry point modules (this is expected)
- Utils as directory is anti-pattern - flatten to root level when small

**Next Session Goals**:
- Implement embeddings module (sentence-transformers wrapper)
- OR create FAISS vector store wrapper
- OR initialize DVC for data versioning
- OR start building simple RAG chain with LangChain
