## üìù Session Notes

### Session 2025-10-09 (Initial Setup)
**Topics Covered**:
- Project architecture design
- Tech stack validation against 2025 industry standards
- Decision to use pgvector + FAISS (not Pinecone)
- Addition of LlamaIndex alongside LangChain
- AWS as primary cloud, GCP for Google Patents
- DVC for data versioning

**User Feedback**:
- Wants to implement code themselves with guidance
- Prefers industry-standard, high-demand technologies
- Interested in learning path from prototype to production

**Next Session Goals**:
- Start Phase 0 implementation
- First step: Create project folder structure
- User wants to implement themselves with AI guidance
- Ask user what component they want to start with

**What User Should Do Next**:
1. Decide which Phase 0 component to start (see checklist above)
2. Ask AI for guidance on that specific component
3. Implement code themselves
4. Share code for review and feedback

---

## üîÑ Change Log

**2025-10-09**:
- Created project documentation (README, PROJECT_CONTEXT, PROGRESS)
- Finalized tech stack after research
- Confirmed learning-focused approach
- Phase 0 ready to begin

---

## üìå Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Commands will be added as user implements features

# Planned for Phase 0:
# docker-compose up -d
# uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload
# dvc init
# mlflow ui
# pytest tests/
```

---

## üéØ Success Metrics

**Phase 0 Goals**:
- User can run entire stack locally with `docker-compose up`
- Basic RAG query works end-to-end
- User understands RAG architecture
- Code follows best practices (type hints, error handling, logging)
- Tests cover core functionality

**Project Success Criteria** (Long-term):
- Production-ready RAG system deployed on AWS
- Handles 1000+ queries/day
- <2s p95 latency
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- User confident in RAG/LLM production patterns
